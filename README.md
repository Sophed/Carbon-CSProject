### A project for my GCSE computer science class.

Our task was to create a GUI application in python using Tkinter (it sucks I know), to manage the user and business details of a fictional shopping district. I designed the UI in Figma and then pain stakingly built it up in Tkinter. The logins are stored in plain text, I could encrypt them if I wanted but I wouldn't get extra marks for it so what would be the point :p

## Install (why would you want to)

### Linux
Install the `tk` package, at least that's what it is in Arch, idk about other distros :/

### All
Open up a terminal and run `pip install tkinter` if you don't already have it installed.
Then you can just `python main.py` and it should probably run. If it doesn't don't bother making an issue, I won't fix it.
